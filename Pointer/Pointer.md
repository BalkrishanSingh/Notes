# What are Pointers?

A **pointer** is a variable that holds the address of another variable.

# How to Use Pointers

### Defining a Pointer Variable
- Use a data type followed by an asterisk `*` to define a pointer variable.

### Assigning the Address of a Variable to a Pointer
- Use the unary operator `&` to get the address of a variable and assign it to a pointer.

### Accessing the Value Stored in the Address
- Use the unary operator `*` to access the value stored in the address the pointer is pointing to.
